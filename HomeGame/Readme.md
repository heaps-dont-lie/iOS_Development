As part of the Beta submission, the main fatures of my app, that is, the game and the multiplayer functionality has been implemented.

1. In order to play the game as a single player you can download the game on your iphone with iOS 15+ and click on "New Game" as the app launches. Through a physical device you can manuever the player by moving the device.

2. In order to play multiplayer run the app on 2 simulators (preferably iphone 14 pro iOS 15+). Then click on multiplayer and choose a device to host a
and click on "Match up" button on the other device so that the hosting device can invite. Follow from the image below.
Note: For some reason the the physical device is not getting ddiscoverred. This will be fixed as part of the final release. So, in order to tackle this in the Beta release I have added left "<-" and right "->" arrow keys to move the player. This patch is only temporary and for testing purposes.

3. Once the game starts you can see some information at the top right corner. Also, there is a button "End Game" whhich when clicked ends the game. When "End Game" is tapped upon during a multiplayer session, the appropriate data is exchangedd in order to proceed with the challenge. 


Note: I have implemented the core functionalities although there are minor bugs and features left to be added and will be seen in the final release. For instane, there potentailly will be another mutiplayer mode where players can play live (can see each other on their screen). In adddition, there would be a proper pause button instead of "End Game" button, player history, resume game button, UI improvements etc. I will also ad various featutes in the game as well like the difficulty etc.
